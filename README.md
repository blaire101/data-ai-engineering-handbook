<summary>💬 Spark basic questions</summary>

**The Key Insight:**

| | Single-stage | Two-stage |
|---|---|---|
| Memory model | One giant HashSet | Many small groups |
| Spillable | No | Yes |
| OOM risk | High | Low |
| Speed | Faster (small data) | Stable (large/skewed data) |

> The real benefit is not speed — it's **converting unspillable memory structures into spillable ones**, so Spark can handle skewed keys without crashing.

# Spark Interview Quick Reference

---

## 1. Core Concepts

| Concept | One-Line Answer | Key Points |
|---|---|---|
| **What is Spark?** | Distributed computing engine, in-memory, DAG-based, faster than MapReduce | Supports Python, Scala, Java, SQL |
| **RDD** | Immutable, partitioned, distributed collection. Low-level API | Supports `map`, `filter`, `reduceByKey` |
| **DataFrame** | Distributed table with schema, optimized by Catalyst | Like distributed Pandas, faster than RDD |
| **Lazy Evaluation** | Builds DAG of transformations, executes only when action is called | Transformation = lazy, Action = triggers execution |
| **Transformation** | Lazy operation producing new RDD/DataFrame | `map`, `filter`, `groupBy` |
| **Action** | Triggers actual computation, returns result | `collect`, `count`, `show`, `save` |

---

## 2. Execution Model

| Concept | One-Line Answer | Key Points |
|---|---|---|
| **Job** | Triggered by an action | One action = one job |
| **Stage** | Set of tasks between shuffle boundaries | Split by wide transformations |
| **Task** | Unit of execution on one partition | One partition = one task |
| **DAGScheduler** | Converts DAG into stages | Splits at shuffle boundaries |
| **TaskScheduler** | Assigns tasks to executors | Handles retries and locality |
| **Driver** | Coordinates execution, collects results | Runs your `main()` code |
| **Executor** | Runs tasks on worker nodes | Has thread pool for parallel tasks |

**Memory formula:**
> Action → Job → Stage → Task → Executor

---

## 3. Catalyst Optimizer

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **Logical Plan** | Parse SQL/DataFrame into unresolved plan |
| **Analyzed Plan** | Resolve column names, check schema |
| **Optimized Plan** | Apply rules: predicate pushdown, column pruning, join reordering |
| **Physical Plan** | Choose operators: HashAggregate vs SortMergeJoin |

---

## 4. Shuffle

| Concept | One-Line Answer | Key Points |
|---|---|---|
| **What is shuffle?** | Data redistribution across partitions | Expensive: disk I/O + network + serialization |
| **Why expensive?** | Data must move across nodes | Serialization + network transfer + disk write |
| **Narrow transformation** | Each parent partition → one child partition | No shuffle: `map`, `filter`, `union` |
| **Wide transformation** | Parent partitions → multiple child partitions | Shuffle needed: `groupBy`, `join`, `reduceByKey` |

---

## 5. Data Skew

| Skew Type | Cause | Solution |
|---|---|---|
| **Input files** | Many small files or one huge file | Repartition, merge small files, use Parquet |
| **Join keys** | Hot key appears millions of times | Broadcast join, salting, AQE |
| **Aggregation keys** | Hot key dominates GROUP BY | Two-stage aggregation + salting |
| **General** | Uneven partition sizes | AQE, tune shuffle partitions |

**Symptoms:**
| Symptom | Meaning |
|---|---|
| One task runs much longer | Data skew |
| Executor OOM | HashSet explosion on hot key |
| High shuffle read time | I/O bottleneck, not CPU |
| GC pauses | Memory pressure |

---

## 6. Two-Stage Aggregation

| | Single-Stage | Two-Stage |
|---|---|---|
| **Memory model** | One giant HashSet per group | Many small spillable groups |
| **Spillable** | No | Yes |
| **OOM risk** | High | Low |
| **Speed** | Faster (small data) | Stable (large/skewed data) |

**Two steps:**

| Stage | SQL | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| **Stage 1** | `GROUP BY (key, sender_id)` | Deduplicate sender_id first |
| **Stage 2** | `GROUP BY (key) → COUNT(*)` | Count deduplicated rows |

**Why it works:**
> Converts one unspillable giant HashSet → many small spillable sorted groups

---

## 7. Salting

| Step | What happens |
|---|---|
| **Identify hot key** | e.g. `US+Wise+USD` with 4M records |
| **Add salt bucket** | `hash(sender_id) % 8` → buckets 0-7 |
| **Stage 1** | Each bucket goes to separate reducer |
| **Stage 2** | Merge results from all buckets |

**Important rule:**
> Salt must be deterministic based on the distinct key (not random per row), otherwise COUNT(DISTINCT) will be wrong

**Salting vs AQE:**

| | AQE | Salting |
|---|---|---|
| **Timing** | After shuffle (runtime) | Before shuffle (logical rewrite) |
| **Implementation** | Automatic | Manual SQL change |
| **Best for** | Mild skew | Known extreme hot keys |
| **Limitation** | Cannot rebalance single extreme hot key | Requires knowing hot keys in advance |

---

## 8. HashAgg vs SortAgg

| | HashAggregate | SortAggregate |
|---|---|---|
| **Memory** | High (in-memory HashSet) | Low (disk spillable) |
| **OOM risk** | High | Low |
| **Speed** | Faster for small data | Stable for large/skewed data |
| **Use when** | No skew, small data | Skewed data, large data |

---

## 9. AQE (Adaptive Query Execution)

| Function | What it does | Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| **Coalesce partitions** | Merges small shuffle partitions at runtime | Fewer tasks, less overhead |
| **Skew join split** | Splits large skewed partitions into multiple tasks | Eliminates long-tail tasks |
| **Switch join strategy** | SortMergeJoin → BroadcastHashJoin at runtime | Better performance |

**AQE limitation:**
> Can split partitions but cannot rebalance a single extreme hot key. Manual salting still needed for extreme cases.

---

## 10. Join Strategies

| Strategy | When to use | How it works |
|---|---|---|
| **BroadcastHashJoin** | Small table < 10MB | Send small table to all executors, no shuffle |
| **SortMergeJoin** | Both tables large | Sort both sides, merge on key |
| **ShuffleHashJoin** | One side fits in memory | Hash the smaller side, probe with larger |

## 12. Quick Answers

| Question | Answer (say this first) |
|---|---|
| What is Spark? | Distributed in-memory computing engine, DAG-based, faster than MapReduce |
| What is shuffle? | Data redistribution across partitions. Expensive: disk I/O + network + serialization |
| What is data skew? | Unbalanced data across partitions. Causes OOM and long-tail tasks |
| How did you solve skew? | Two-stage aggregation + targeted salting + AQE. 75min→13min |
| What is AQE? | Runtime optimization: coalesces small partitions, splits skewed ones, switches join strategies |
| HashAgg vs SortAgg? | HashAgg faster but OOM risk. SortAgg spillable, stable for skewed data |
| What is lazy evaluation? | Transformations build a DAG. Nothing executes until an action is called |
| What is Catalyst? | Spark's query optimizer. SQL → Logical → Analyzed → Optimized → Physical Plan |

1. **User Program (DataFrame / SQL / RDD)**

   * The developer writes Spark code using DataFrames, SQL, or RDD APIs.

2. **SparkSession**

   * Entry point of Spark. <mark>**Translates**</mark> user code into Spark’s internal representations.
   * SparkSession is the <mark>**bridge**</mark> between the **user world (DataFrame / SQL / RDD APIs)** and **Spark’s internal world (Plans / DAGs / Tasks)**.

3. **Catalyst Optimizer (Logical → Physical Plan)**

   * Spark uses Catalyst to optimize SQL/DataFrame queries.
   * It creates a **Logical Plan**, applies optimization rules, and produces a **Physical Plan**, 

4. **DAG of Transformations (RDD DAG - RDD Lineage is Lineage Graph)**

   * From the physical plan, Spark builds a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** of transformations.
   * The DAG represents dependencies between RDDs.  for example: **map → filter → join**

5. Lazy Execution until Action

   * Transformations are only recorded.
   * Nothing runs until an Action (e.g., collect, count, save) is triggered.

<details>
<summary><strong>Spark Code - Lazy Execution until Action</strong></summary>

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.functions import length, col

# ✅ Step 0 — Create a SparkSession (Unified entry point in Spark 3.3+)
spark = SparkSession.builder \
    .appName("SparkLazyEvaluationDemo") \
    .master("local[*]") \
    .getOrCreate()

# ✅ Step 1 — Create initial DataFrame (Lazy; logical plan only, not executed yet)
df = spark.createDataFrame(
    [("Spark is fast",), ("Big data",), ("Spark powers analytics",)],
    ["value"]
)
# Conceptual content of df (Spark has not executed anything yet):
# +-------------------------+
# | value                   |
# +-------------------------+
# | Spark is fast           |
# | Big data                |
# | Spark powers analytics  |
# +-------------------------+

# ✅ Step 2 — Apply transformations (Still lazy; no execution yet)
df2 = df.filter(col("value").contains("Spark")) \
        .withColumn("length", length(col("value")))
# Conceptual content of df2 (still lazy, not executed yet):
# +-------------------------+--------+
# | value                   | length |
# +-------------------------+--------+
# | Spark is fast           | 14     |
# | Spark powers analytics  | 24     |
# +-------------------------+--------+

# ✅ Step 3 — Action: show() triggers actual execution
df2.show()

# ✅ Step 4 — Stop SparkSession
spark.stop()
```

```python
from pyspark import SparkContext

sc = SparkContext("local", "LazyEvaluationExample")

# Step 1: Create an RDD (Lazy - no computation yet)
rdd = sc.parallelize(["Spark is fast", "Big data", "Spark powers analytics"])
# RDD content (conceptually): ["Spark is fast", "Big data", "Spark powers analytics"]

# Step 2: Transformation: filter (Lazy)
filtered_rdd = rdd.filter(lambda line: "Spark" in line)
# Conceptual result (not executed yet): ["Spark is fast", "Spark powers analytics"]

# Step 3: Transformation: map (Lazy)
mapped_rdd = filtered_rdd.map(lambda line: (line, len(line)))
# Conceptual result (not executed yet):
# [
#   ("Spark is fast", 14),
#   ("Spark powers analytics", 24)
# ]

# Step 4: Action: collect() (Triggers execution, returns actual results)
result = mapped_rdd.collect()
# Actual result after execution:
# [
#   ("Spark is fast", 14),
#   ("Spark powers analytics", 24)
# ]
print(result)
sc.stop()
```

</details>
    
> In Spark, transformations like **filter** and **map are lazy** — they are only recorded in the DAG and not executed immediately.  
> Actual execution happens only when an action like collect is triggered.
In this example, the **RDD chain is built in steps 1-3**, but **Spark only runs them at step 4**.

> Responsible for: actually executing the tasks and running the DAG.
> Keywords: Action → DAGScheduler → Stages → TaskScheduler → Executors → Driver.

1. **Action (collect / count / save)**

   * When an action is triggered, Spark executes the DAG to actually process the data.
   * Until an action is called, transformations remain **lazy**.

2. **DAGScheduler (DAG → Stages)** <mark>Scheduling DAG</mark> – the actual execution graph of computation tasks.

   * Splits the DAG into **Stages** based on shuffle boundaries.
   * Each stage contains a set of tasks that can run in parallel.

3. **Stage (split into Tasks)**

   * A stage is further divided into multiple **Tasks**, one per partition.

4. **TaskScheduler (Tasks → Executors)**

   * The TaskScheduler assigns tasks to worker nodes (Executors).
   * Handles task retries and scheduling policies.

5. **Driver (collects Results)**

   * The Driver program coordinates execution.
   * Collects results from Executors and returns them to the user program.


> 1. The **<mark>DAG</mark>** is only executed when you call an **<mark>action</mark>** (e.g., `collect`, `count`, `save`).  
> 2. At this point, the **<mark>DAGScheduler</mark>** converts the **<mark>logical DAG</mark>** into a **<mark>DAG of stages</mark>**.  
> 3. Each **<mark>stage</mark>** is then further divided into multiple **<mark>tasks</mark>**.  
> 4. The **<mark>TaskScheduler</mark>** is responsible for **<mark>scheduling</mark>** these **<mark>tasks</mark>** to **<mark>executors</mark>** and **<mark>monitoring</mark>** their execution.

## 🟨 2. Execution Model

### 2.1 📌 **<mark>Job → Stage → Task</mark>**

| No. | Question | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7 | What is a Spark job? | Triggered by action ("collect, take(n), saveAsTextFile(path), show..DF"), Spark creates a job - **<mark>consists of stages</mark>**, |
| 8 | What is a stage in Spark? | a set of parallel **tasks** that execute the same computation on different **partitions of the data**. <br> **<mark>A set of tasks</mark>** between shuffles. |
| 9 | What is a task? | **<mark>Unit of execution</mark>** on a partition. |

| Stage0 | contains narrow transformations (e.g. `map`, `filter`) **and writes shuffle output if followed by a wide transformation** | 👉 Divided into multiple **Tasks**, each processing **one input partition** (e.g. Partition 0, 1, 2), executing all narrow transformations **in parallel**. Shuffle files are written if needed for Stage1. |
| Stage1 | begins **after Stage 0 completes**, involves **wide transformations** (e.g. `reduceByKey`)                                | 👉 Divided into **Tasks** operating on **shuffled partitions** (e.g. Partition A, B). Tasks run **in parallel**, and once Stage 1 completes, the **final result** is returned to the **Driver**.            |

> Wide Dependency : A parent partition may be used by multiple child partitions.

### 2.2 Spark Component

| No. | Component       | What It Does |
| --- |-----------------|-------------|
| 1 | Client | Acts as the client on the user’s behalf, responsible for submitting applications.
| 2 | **Driver**      | Runs your main application code (`main()`), creates the `SparkContext` <br> Responsible for the scheduling of jobs, i.e., the distribution of tasks. Think of it as the “orchestrator” of your Spark job. |
| 3 | **Worker**      | A machine/node in the cluster that runs executors. It follows the driver’s instructions and reports back its status. |
| 4 | **Executor**    | Runs the actual tasks on a worker node. Each executor has a pool of threads to process multiple tasks in parallel. |
| 5 | **Cluster Manager** | Controls the cluster (like the “master controller”). In Standalone mode, it launches workers, monitors them, and helps schedule jobs. |

## 🟧 3. Shuffle & Partitioning

📌 **Shuffle = Costly, Wide vs Narrow**

| --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | What is a shuffle in Spark? | Data redistribution across partitions. Data **<mark>redistribution across partitions</mark>**, which may involve moving data between **<mark>Executors (nodes)</mark>** over the **<mark>network</mark>**.  <br><br> This makes it an **<mark>expensive operation</mark>** due to **<mark>disk I/O</mark>**, **<mark>network transfer</mark>**, and **<mark>serialization</mark>**. |
| 11 | Why is shuffle expensive? | Disk I/O + network + serialization. |
| 12 | What is the difference between narrow and wide transformations? | Narrow = no shuffle, Wide = shuffle needed. |

| No. | ❓Question   | ✅ Answer| 📘 Notes                                                                                                    
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | What is a Narrow Dependency in Spark?  | A **narrow dependency** means that **each partition** of the parent RDD is used by **at most one partition** of the child RDD.                            | No shuffle is required. Examples include `map`, `filter`, and `union`. These operations allow pipelined execution and are typically faster and more efficient.           |
| 2   | What is a Wide Dependency in Spark?    | A **wide dependency** means that **multiple partitions** of the parent RDD may be used by **multiple partitions** of the child RDD.                       | This necessitates a shuffle across the cluster, typically seen in operations like `groupBy`, `reduceByKey`, or `join`. It incurs higher overhead and network transfer.   |
| 3   | Why are Wide Dependencies expensive?   | Because they involve **shuffles**, during which data must be **redistributed** across nodes, leading to **disk I/O**, **network transfer**, and **skew**. | Wide dependencies are often the primary bottleneck. Optimisation may require techniques such as salting, repartitioning, or adaptive execution.                         |
| 4   | Can Spark optimise Wide Dependencies?  | Yes, Spark can use **Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)** to detect skew and adjust partitioning dynamically to reduce overhead.                             | Enable configs like `spark.sql.adaptive.enabled` and `spark.sql.adaptive.skewJoin.enabled`. AQE may merge small partitions or split skewed ones to improve performance. |

🔁 Task Count Comparison

| Stage   | Task Type | Count | Description 
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Stage 1** | **Shuffle Map Tasks** | **3** | One task per input partition (P0–P2). Each task executes all narrow transformations (map/flatMap/…) in a pipeline, then buckets records by key and writes **2 shuffle outputs** (for partitions A and B). |
| **Stage 2** | **Reduce Tasks**      | **2** | One task per output partition (A, B). **Each reduce task fetches its partition’s blocks from all 3 shuffle map tasks** (one block per map task), then merges/aggregates to produce the final result.      |

## 4. Data Skew（skewness)

🔥 Data Skew in Spark - *Unbalanced data across partitions*

| Category  | Optimization Methods | Notes / Best Practices                       
| --- | --- | --- | 
| 1️⃣ Skewed Input Files         | Repartitioning, **<mark>Merging small files</mark>**, Using columnar file formats (Parquet/ORC), Increasing `spark.sql.files.maxPartitionBytes` <br> `spark.sql.files.openCostInBytes` | Avoid too many small files that lead to excessive tasks or file handle pressure; control partition sizes appropriately                               |
| 2️⃣ Skewed Join Keys           | Broadcast Join, **<mark>Salting, Adaptive Query Execution (AQE)</mark>**, Map-side join               | For highly skewed join keys, AQE can split large partitions at runtime or broadcast small tables to reduce shuffle                                   |
| 3️⃣ Skewed Aggregation         | **<mark>Salting + Two-stage aggregation, AQE coalesce partitions</mark>**                             | For uneven key distributions in aggregations, pre-salt to scatter keys, then aggregate and remove salt; AQE can automatically split large partitions |
| 4️⃣ General Tuning & SQL Hints | SQL hints (e.g., `/*+ BROADCAST */`), Repartitioning, AQE (coalesce & skew join), Cache/Checkpoint    | Overall performance tuning: use hints to guide joins/partitions, cache hotspot data appropriately, adjust parallelism                                |

| # | Question | Summary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 13 | **What is data skew?** | **<mark>Unbalanced data across partitions</mark>**. <br> It often occurs when a few keys have significantly more records than others.  <br> This leads to some tasks running much longer than others, causing **performance bottlenecks** and **OOM errors**.|
| 14 | What causes it? | Skewed key distribution. |
| 15 | Why is it bad? | Causes long-running tasks, resource underuse. |
| 16 | How to detect it? | Spark UI (task duration, skewed keys). |
| 17 | What ops are sensitive? | Joins, groupByKey, reduceByKey. |
| 18 | What is salting? | Adding randomness to distribute hot keys. |
| 19 | How does salting+grouping work? | Salt keys → aggregate → merge. |
| 20 | What is a broadcast join? | Send small table to all workers. |
| 21 | When to use broadcast? | Small tables (<10MB), skewed joins. |
| 22 | What Spark configs help? | `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`, `autoBroadcastJoinThreshold`. |
| 23 | What is AQE? | Adaptive runtime optimizations (incl. skew fix). |
| 24 | Other methods to handle skew? | Filter hot keys, use approx algorithms, repartition. |

| AQE  —  Functions    | What It Does - (Adaptive Query Execution)   |    Benefit      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **1. Dynamically coalesce shuffle partitions** | Merges many small shuffle partitions into fewer larger ones at runtime                                      | Reduces empty tasks, lowers scheduling overhead   |
| **2. Handle skewed joins (skew split)**        | Detects skewed partitions (hot keys) and splits them into multiple tasks   <br> It will add a <mark>final aggregation step</mark> to merge the intermediate results. <br><br> “AQE can automatically **split a large partition into multiple tasks**, so it works well when the partition contains multiple keys. But if a partition is dominated by a single extreme hot key, AQE can only slice the file, not rebalance the key itself. **The key still ends up as one group**, so the fundamental skew problem remains. That’s why in extreme skew cases, we still need manual techniques like salting.”     | Avoids long-tail stragglers, improves parallelism |
| **3. Switch join strategies at runtime**       | Can change SortMergeJoin → BroadcastHashJoin (or others) if actual stats differ from estimates              | Better performance, avoids unnecessary shuffles   |
| **4. Improve overall robustness**              | Uses *runtime statistics* (row count, size, distribution) instead of relying only on compile-time estimates | More stable performance even with bad statistics  |

- Otherwise default = SMJ for equi-joins (because spark.sql.join.preferSortMergeJoin=true by default). 
- SHJ: considered when SMJ is not preferred (set spark.sql.join.preferSortMergeJoin=false, or hint /*+ SHUFFLE_HASH(t) */). Spark uses a per-partition hash map on the build side.

<details>
<summary><strong>Q1: After Spark reads data, what determines the number of partitions, and what is the role of `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`? Is setting it to 200 meaningful?</strong></summary>

- The initial partition count is determined by the data source (e.g., HDFS block size, file format, and parallelism).
- `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` sets the number of partitions **after a shuffle** (e.g., joins, aggregations, groupBy), not during file read.
- Setting it to 200 can be helpful for **large datasets**, increasing parallelism; however, it might introduce overhead for small datasets.

```sql
-- Set partition count for shuffle
SET spark.sql.shuffle.partitions = 200;
```

#### 🔍 Detailed Explanation:

##### 1.1 Input Partitioning:
- Spark reads data based on HDFS block size or other input format configurations. This determines the **initial parallelism**.

##### 1.2 Read & Partition:
- After reading, data is split into partitions.
- More partitions = more parallel tasks = higher throughput (if cluster resources allow).

##### 1.3 Map Phase:
- Tasks transform data within their partition.
- No shuffle or inter-node communication occurs in this phase.

##### 1.4 Reduce Phase:
- Shuffle re-partitions data based on key, such as `groupBy`, `join`, etc.
- Number of reduce tasks is controlled by `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`.

##### 1.5 Partitions ↔️ Tasks:
- One partition = One task.
- Parallelism depends on partition count **and** available cluster resources (e.g., executor cores).

<summary><strong>Q2: What's the difference between MapReduce and Spark in terms of shuffle and memory?</strong></summary>

- **Spark**: Supports in-memory computation and DAG execution.
- **MapReduce**: Always writes intermediate data to disk.

| Aspect  | Spark (Closest Feature)        | MapReduce (MR)   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Execution Model** | **<mark>DAG of stages</mark>**; in-memory, **<mark>pipelined execution</mark>** | Two fixed stages: Map → Reduce; disk-based    |
| **Shuffle**         | Sort-based Shuffle with optimizations (AQE, push-based, bypass merge) | Always disk + full sort, heavy I/O            |
| **Intermediate Data** | Cached in memory (spill to disk only if needed) | Written to disk every stage                 |
| **Fault Tolerance** | RDD lineage recomputes only lost partitions  | Restart tasks using on-disk data

#### 🔹 (1) In-Memory Advantage:

- Spark can cache data in memory across stages, significantly reducing I/O overhead.
- MapReduce flushes to HDFS between each stage.

#### 🔹 (2) DAG Execution:

- Spark builds a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of stages and tasks.
- Reduces unnecessary data writes by chaining operations intelligently.

</div>

#### 🔹 (3) Spark Architecture:

- **Driver & SparkContext**: Starts app, builds DAG via RDD/DataFrame ops.
- **DAG Scheduler**: Splits stages, submits tasks.
- **Execution Engine**: Executes tasks on workers.

<summary><strong> Q3: Why is "Shuffle Read" the bottleneck in skewed aggregations?</strong></summary>

- Spark **reduce tasks** fetch partition files written by map tasks — this is the **Shuffle Read** stage.
- Under skew, some partitions are significantly larger → more data to read → **slower tasks**.
- Aggregation (CPU-bound) is usually lightweight vs I/O-heavy Shuffle Read.

#### 📊 Spark UI Indicators:

- **Shuffle Read Time**: High = skewed data fetch.
- **Task CPU Time**: Usually low even in skew cases.

<summary><strong>Q4: How do I troubleshoot Spark performance problems?</strong></summary>

| **Step** | **Description**  | **Key Focus** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Web UI** | Identify slow jobs and stages.  | Optimize resource allocation and adjust configurations. |
| **2. SQL Code & DAG Inspection** | Analyze long SQL queries and the corresponding DAG to pinpoint problematic parts  | Simplify query logic and optimize expensive operations. |
| **3. Examine Execution Plans** | Use EXPLAIN to view the logical, optimized logical, and physical plans. Focus on problematic nodes like **HashAggregate, SortAggregate, SortMergeJoin**, etc. | Identify problematic nodes and adjust join strategies or grouping techniques. |
| **4.** Web UI - **Stage Summary Metrics** | Analyze task metrics in the Spark Web UI (execution time, data processed) to detect data skew, slow tasks, or resource bottlenecks. | Identify data skew and resource bottlenecks by examining task-level metrics. |
| **5. Data Context Investigation** | Examine the underlying datasets (e.g., using GROUP BY and COUNT queries) to detect skewed keys or large columns that may cause performance issues. | Collaborate with teams to adjust the data model or partitioning strategy if necessary. |

💡 Also monitor:
- **Shuffle Read Time**: If it dominates, the issue is I/O, not CPU.
- **Task Duration Distribution**: Long tails often mean skew.
- **Spill Metrics**: Frequent spills imply memory pressure.
