## Part 1 — Data Ingestion & Transformation (34%)

**The heaviest domain — nearly 1 in 3 exam questions.** Covers streaming, batch ingestion, ETL, orchestration, and programming concepts. Start here and don't rush it.

![Domain 1 pipeline overview](docs/p1-pipeline-overview.svg)

### Step 1.1 — Perform Data Ingestion

**Streaming vs Batch — when to use what:** Streaming sources deliver data continuously in real time — Kinesis Data Streams for custom real-time applications, MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka) for Kafka-native workloads, DynamoDB Streams for capturing table changes, AWS DMS for continuous database replication. Batch sources process data in scheduled intervals — S3 for file-based loads, Glue for large ETL, EMR for distributed processing, AppFlow for SaaS connectors, Lambda for lightweight event-driven triggers.

| Scenario | Service to use | Why |
|----------|-----------------|-----|
| Real-time clickstream from mobile app | Kinesis Data Streams | Sub-second latency, consumer fan-out |
| Existing Kafka workload on-prem | Amazon MSK | Managed Kafka, no migration of producer code |
| Trigger ETL when a file lands in S3 | S3 Event Notifications + Lambda | EventBridge or direct Lambda trigger |
| Replicate RDS to S3 continuously | AWS DMS (CDC mode) | Change Data Capture, near-real-time |
| SaaS data (Salesforce → S3) | Amazon AppFlow | No-code connector, scheduled or event-triggered |

**Key concepts to lock in before moving on:**
- **Fan-in / fan-out:** fan-in aggregates multiple streams into one consumer; fan-out distributes one stream to multiple consumers (Kinesis Enhanced Fan-Out)
- **Stateful vs stateless:** stateful maintains context across events (session data); stateless treats each event independently
- **Replayability:** Kinesis retains records for 24h–365 days, allowing replay; SQS does not natively support ordered replay
- **Throttling:** when hitting DynamoDB or RDS rate limits, use exponential backoff, SQS as buffer, or Kinesis Firehose to absorb spikes

### Step 1.2 — Transform and Process Data

**AWS Glue** is the primary ETL service — serverless, scales automatically, supports PySpark, integrates natively with S3, Redshift, and the Glue Data Catalog. **Amazon EMR** is for large-scale distributed processing needing full Spark/Hadoop control. **Lambda** handles lightweight, event-driven transformations under 15 minutes. **Redshift** does in-warehouse transformations using SQL when data is already loaded.

> ⭐ **NEW v1.1 — LLM Integration in Data Pipelines:** The exam now tests LLM integration in data processing. Key patterns: using Amazon Bedrock to classify or enrich records as part of a Glue ETL job, calling Bedrock inference APIs from Lambda for per-record enrichment, and using Bedrock knowledge bases for semantic search over processed documents. This is genuinely new — don't skip it just because it feels unfamiliar.

| Format conversion | Tool | Key benefit |
|--------------------|------|-------------|
| CSV → Parquet | Glue ETL job | Columnar format reduces Athena query cost by ~80% |
| JSON → Avro | Glue or Kafka Streams | Schema evolution support |
| Unstructured → structured | Lambda + Bedrock | LLM extraction of fields |

### Step 1.3 — Orchestrate Data Pipelines

**AWS Step Functions** is a visual state machine for complex branching, error handling, and retry logic. **Amazon MWAA** (Managed Apache Airflow) suits teams already using Airflow DAGs. **AWS Glue Workflows** is simpler/cheaper when the entire pipeline lives in Glue. **EventBridge** is for event-driven triggers, not full orchestration.

| Tool | Best for | Avoid when |
|------|----------|------------|
| Step Functions | Multi-service workflows with complex branching | Need Python-native DAG syntax |
| MWAA | Existing Airflow users, rich scheduling | Simple single-service pipelines |
| Glue Workflows | Glue-only pipelines | Need cross-service orchestration |
| EventBridge | Event-driven triggers (time-based, S3 events) | Complex dependency chains |

### Step 1.4 — Apply Programming Concepts

The exam tests concepts, not code. Know that Lambda **reserved concurrency** sets a hard cap per function to prevent throttling under burst load. IaC: **CloudFormation** deploys templates declaratively, **CDK** generates CloudFormation using Python/TypeScript, **SAM** is CloudFormation simplified for serverless. CI/CD typically means CodePipeline triggering Glue job deployment or Lambda updates. A **DAG** (Directed Acyclic Graph — Airflow, Step Functions) prevents circular dependencies.

### 🌳 Decision tree — which ingestion path?

![Ingestion decision tree](docs/p1-ingestion-decision-tree.svg)

### ⚡ Part 1 Cheat Sheet — fast recall table

| If you see... | Pick... |
|----------------|---------|
| "real-time", "sub-second", "clickstream" | Kinesis Data Streams |
| "Kafka", "on-prem streaming" | Amazon MSK |
| "serverless ETL", "PySpark", "no cluster" | AWS Glue |
| "full Spark control", "Hadoop", "huge scale" | Amazon EMR |
| "complex branching", "retry logic", "state machine" | Step Functions |

### ✅ Before moving to Part 2, self-check

- [ ] I can explain the difference between Kinesis and MSK without looking it up
- [ ] I know when to pick Step Functions over MWAA
- [ ] I can explain what "replayability" means for a streaming pipeline
- [ ] I can name at least two ways Bedrock gets used in a Glue/Lambda pipeline

---

## Part 2 — Data Store Management (26%)

Choosing the right data store, cataloging, lifecycle management, and data modelling. This part builds directly on the services introduced in Part 1 — you'll be choosing where the ingested/transformed data actually lives.

### Step 2.1 — Choose the Right Data Store

| Use case | Service | Key differentiator |
|----------|---------|---------------------|
| Data warehouse / analytics | Amazon Redshift | MPP columnar, RA3 nodes, Spectrum for S3 |
| Big data distributed processing | Amazon EMR | Full Spark/Hadoop control, spot instances |
| Data lake management | AWS Lake Formation | Centralised permissions on top of S3 + Glue Catalog |
| Relational / OLTP | RDS / Aurora | Aurora is 5x MySQL / 3x PostgreSQL performance |
| NoSQL key-value (massive scale) | DynamoDB | Single-digit ms at any scale, serverless |
| Real-time streaming store | Kinesis / MSK | Kinesis for AWS-native; MSK for Kafka compatibility |
| Fast key-value cache | MemoryDB for Redis | Durable Redis, microsecond reads |
| Vector similarity search ⭐ | Aurora PostgreSQL + HNSW / IVF | New in v1.1 — for ML embedding search |

> ⭐ **NEW v1.1 — Apache Iceberg and Vector Indexes:** Apache Iceberg is an open table format for data lakes — provides ACID transactions, schema evolution, and time travel on top of S3. Iceberg offers row-level updates/deletes (Hive does not), full schema evolution without table rewrites, and partition evolution without data migration. For vector indexes: **HNSW** (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) is approximate nearest-neighbour search optimised for speed; **IVF** (Inverted File Index) clusters vectors and searches clusters first, good for very large datasets.

### 🗺️ Visual — matching workload shape to data store

![Workload shape to data store mapping](docs/p2-workload-to-datastore.svg)

### Step 2.2 — Data Cataloging Systems

**AWS Glue Data Catalog** is the primary technical metadata catalog — stores table schemas, partition information, connection definitions; backing store for Athena, EMR, Redshift Spectrum. **Glue Crawlers** auto-discover schemas by sampling data. **Apache Hive Metastore** is the open-source equivalent, used for on-prem Hadoop compatibility. **Amazon SageMaker Catalog** (new in v1.1) is a business-facing catalog for data discovery.

### Step 2.3 — Manage Data Lifecycle

![S3 storage tier cost versus access frequency](docs/p2-s3-storage-tiers.svg)

S3 Standard is for frequently accessed data — highest cost. S3 Standard-IA is for data accessed less than monthly — lower storage cost, retrieval fee applies. S3 Glacier Instant matches Standard-IA pricing for quarterly access. S3 Glacier Flexible takes minutes-to-hours — for backups. S3 Glacier Deep Archive is cheapest — under $1/TB/month, 12-hour retrieval. Use **S3 Lifecycle Policies** to automate tier transitions based on object age.

### Step 2.4 — Data Models and Schema Evolution

**AWS SCT** (Schema Conversion Tool) converts Oracle/SQL Server schemas to Aurora PostgreSQL/MySQL. **AWS DMS Schema Conversion** is the newer managed version integrated into DMS. For Redshift: consider distribution keys (which node owns which data) and sort keys (query performance via data ordering). For DynamoDB: partition key design is critical — avoid hot partitions with high-cardinality keys and write sharding.

### ⚡ Part 2 Cheat Sheet — fast recall table

### ✅ Before moving to Part 3, self-check

- [ ] I can pick the right data store from a one-sentence scenario description
- [ ] I understand why Iceberg matters versus plain Hive tables
- [ ] I can walk through the five S3 storage tiers in order, low to high cost
- [ ] I know the difference between Glue Data Catalog and SageMaker Catalog

## Part 3 — Data Operations & Support (22%)

Automation, analysis, monitoring, and data quality — the "keep it running well" domain. This is where Part 1's pipelines and Part 2's data stores get observed, queried, and quality-checked day to day.

### Step 3.1 — Automate Data Processing

**AWS Glue DataBrew** is a visual data preparation tool — 250+ built-in transformations, no code required. **Amazon Athena** is serverless SQL against S3 — pay per query by data scanned; Parquet + partitioning dramatically cut costs. **Amazon EventBridge** routes events between AWS services and SaaS apps, supports scheduled rules as a cron replacement.

### Step 3.2 — Analyse Data

| Tool | Best use | Exam tip |
|------|----------|----------|
| Amazon QuickSight | BI dashboards, SPICE in-memory engine | SPICE = Super-fast Parallel In-memory Calculation Engine |
| AWS Glue DataBrew | Visual data profiling, cleaning, no-code | For data quality rules and anomaly detection |
| Amazon Athena | Ad-hoc SQL on S3 data | Partitioning + Parquet = lowest query cost |
| Athena + Spark | Interactive notebook for ML prep | No cluster to manage vs EMR |
| SageMaker Data Wrangler | ML-focused data prep + feature engineering | Integrates with SageMaker Pipelines |

**Redshift (provisioned) vs Athena (serverless)** — classic exam tradeoff: Redshift suits consistent, predictable query load with sub-second performance — you pay for capacity regardless of use. Athena suits ad-hoc/unpredictable patterns — pay only for data scanned. Small BI team with occasional reports on S3 → Athena is cheaper. Hundreds of queries/day on a stable warehouse → Redshift gives better performance per dollar.

### Step 3.3 — Maintain and Monitor Pipelines

![Monitoring stack three layers](docs/p3-monitoring-stack.svg)

Start at CloudTrail (what happened), move up to CloudWatch (application detail), OpenSearch when volume exceeds what Logs Insights alone can handle. **Amazon Managed Grafana** visualises metrics/logs from CloudWatch, Prometheus, and other sources on dashboards.

### Step 3.4 — Ensure Data Quality

Common checks: empty fields/null values in mandatory columns, type mismatches, duplicates via primary key violations, completeness (% of expected records arrived). **Glue DataBrew** defines quality rules visually. **Glue Data Quality** (DQDL — Data Quality Definition Language) writes rules in code during Glue ETL jobs. Sampling: simple random sampling is unbiased; **stratified sampling** preserves proportions across subgroups — important for skewed datasets.

### ⚡ Part 3 Cheat Sheet — fast recall table

| If you see... | Pick... |
|----------------|---------|
| "visual data prep", "no-code cleaning" | AWS Glue DataBrew |
| "ad-hoc SQL on S3", "pay per query" | Amazon Athena |
| "BI dashboards", "SPICE" | Amazon QuickSight |
| "predictable heavy query load" | Amazon Redshift (provisioned) |
| "audit every API call" | AWS CloudTrail |

| "log analytics at huge scale" | Amazon OpenSearch Service |
| "null rate threshold alert" | Glue DataBrew data quality rules + SNS |
| "skewed dataset sampling" | Stratified sampling |

### ✅ Before moving to Part 4, self-check

- [ ] I can explain the Redshift vs Athena tradeoff in one sentence
- [ ] I know the order of the three monitoring layers and when to escalate up
- [ ] I can name two quality checks and where to configure them
- [ ] I understand why stratified sampling matters for skewed data

## Part 4 — Data Security & Governance (18%)

Authentication, authorisation, encryption, audit, and privacy. The smallest domain by weight, but scenarios here often assume familiarity with the services from Parts 1-3 — expect questions like "secure the Redshift cluster from Part 2" rather than security in isolation.

![Security layers from identity to encryption](docs/p4-security-layers.svg)

### Step 4.1 & 4.2 — Authentication and Authorisation

Managed policies are reusable across multiple principals; inline policies embed in a single principal for non-reusable permissions. **Principle of least privilege** — grant only what's required. **AWS Lake Formation** adds a permissions layer on S3 + Glue Data Catalog — column-level, row-level, table-level permissions, auto-generates underlying policies. **RBAC** assigns permissions by job function; **ABAC** uses tags on both resource and principal to determine access dynamically.

### Step 4.3 — Encryption and Masking

**AWS KMS** manages encryption keys — CMKs give full rotation control and cross-account capability. S3 encryption: SSE-S3 (AWS-managed, simplest), SSE-KMS (customer control, audit trail, cross-account), SSE-C (customer-provided keys). Encryption in transit = TLS, enforced via `aws:SecureTransport` condition. **Data masking** replaces sensitive values with tokens/hashes for PII in non-prod. **Anonymisation** is irreversible masking.

### Step 4.4 & 4.5 — Audit and Privacy

**CloudTrail** records every API call — who, what, when, from where. **CloudTrail Lake** is a managed event data store queryable with SQL, no S3/Athena setup needed. **Amazon Macie** uses ML to auto-discover and classify PII in S3 (passport numbers, credit cards, health info). Combine Macie with Lake Formation column-level security to auto-restrict access to discovered sensitive columns.

> ⭐ **NEW v1.1 — Governance frameworks and SageMaker Catalog:** Governance covers data quality, lineage, access control, and compliance — not just technical cataloging. SageMaker Catalog is a business-facing metadata catalog for data consumers to discover datasets without technical Glue knowledge, supporting projects, domain units, custom metadata, integrated with SageMaker Unified Studio.

### ⚡ Part 4 Cheat Sheet — fast recall table

| If you see... | Pick... |
|----------------|---------|
| "full control of keys", "custom rotation", "cross-account" | SSE-KMS with Customer Managed Key |
| "simplest S3 encryption", "no key management" | SSE-S3 |
| "column-level security", "row-level filter" | AWS Lake Formation |
| "auto-discover PII", "classify sensitive data" | Amazon Macie |
| "query API history with SQL" | CloudTrail Lake |
| "rotate DB credentials automatically" | AWS Secrets Manager |
| "share live data cross-account, no copy" | Redshift Data Sharing |
| "tags determine access dynamically" | Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) |
| "business-facing governance catalog" | SageMaker Catalog ⭐v1.1 |

### ✅ Before the practice quiz, self-check

- [ ] I can name all four pillars of Domain 4 in order: authenticate → authorise → encrypt → audit
- [ ] I know when to use SSE-KMS vs SSE-S3 vs SSE-C
- [ ] I can explain the difference between RBAC and ABAC
- [ ] I know what Macie does versus what Lake Formation does — they're often confused

## Practice Quiz — 20 Questions

> Answer key is inline after each question. Cover the answer and try each one first. Questions are grouped by Part so you can quiz yourself right after finishing that Part above, or do all 20 together as a final check.

### Part 1 questions

**Q1.** A company needs to ingest clickstream data from a mobile app in real time and process it within 500 milliseconds. Which service is the MOST appropriate?
A. Amazon SQS with Lambda consumer B. **Amazon Kinesis Data Streams with Managed Flink** C. AWS Glue ETL job triggered every minute D. Amazon S3 with EventBridge scheduled rule
> ✅ **B** — Kinesis Data Streams provides sub-second latency; Managed Flink processes streams with millisecond latency. SQS adds polling latency; Glue and S3+EventBridge are batch-oriented.

**Q2.** A data engineer wants to convert 10TB of JSON files in S3 to Parquet to reduce Athena costs. Most cost-effective approach?
A. Load into Redshift, UNLOAD as Parquet B. EC2 with custom PySpark C. **AWS Glue ETL job, JSON → Parquet with Snappy** D. Lambda converting each file individually
> ✅ **C** — Glue is serverless, natively reads JSON/writes Parquet, integrates with the Data Catalog. Lambda has a 15-min timeout/10GB limit — unsuitable for large files.

**Q3.** An application uses DynamoDB and needs to process all table changes in real time to update a search index. Which feature enables this?
A. DynamoDB Global Tables B. DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) C. DynamoDB Point-in-Time Recovery D. **DynamoDB Streams with a Lambda trigger**
> ✅ **D** — DynamoDB Streams captures item-level modifications in near real time; Lambda triggers directly from the stream — standard CDC pattern.

**Q7.** A pipeline ingests 1M records/day from Salesforce, needs a schedule every 6 hours, no code. Simplest solution?
A. Glue custom connector with EventBridge trigger B. Lambda calling Salesforce REST API on schedule C. AWS DMS with Salesforce as source D. **Amazon AppFlow with a scheduled flow every 6 hours**
> ✅ **D** — AppFlow provides no-code Salesforce connectors with native scheduling, field mapping, validation. Glue/Lambda require development; DMS doesn't natively connect to Salesforce.

**Q12.** A pipeline needs complex branching, exponential backoff retry, and parallel execution across 5 Lambdas. Most suitable orchestration tool?
A. EventBridge with multiple rules B. **Step Functions with Map state and Catch/Retry configuration** C. Glue Workflows with triggers D. Lambda calling Lambda in sequence
> ✅ **B** — Step Functions natively supports branching (Choice), parallel (Parallel/Map), retry with backoff, and error handling (Catch). EventBridge routes events; Glue Workflows is Glue-only; Lambda-chaining lacks built-in retry/branching.

**Q15.** A pipeline needs to enrich customer records with LLM-based sentiment analysis of support tickets. Most appropriate architecture? *(v1.1)*
A. Train a custom SageMaker model, call from Glue B. **Call Bedrock's InvokeModel API from Lambda, triggered per record** C. Use Comprehend for entity recognition only D. Store text in Redshift, use a SQL UDF
> ✅ **B** — Bedrock provides foundation models via API — no training needed. This is a key v1.1 addition. Custom training is unnecessary; Comprehend doesn't use an LLM; Redshift UDFs add complexity.

**Q17.** A Lambda function processing Kinesis records times out during spikes. Which TWO changes MOST improve throughput? *(select TWO)*
A. **Increase Kinesis shard count for more parallelism** B. **Increase Lambda reserved concurrency** C. Enable Kinesis Enhanced Fan-Out D. Switch Lambda runtime from Python to Java
> ✅ **A and B** — More shards = more parallel Lambda invocations; more reserved concurrency = capacity to scale without account-level throttling. Enhanced Fan-Out is for multiple distinct consumers, not single-consumer throughput; runtime change doesn't fix a throughput bottleneck.

### Part 2 questions

**Q4.** A company needs ACID transactions, schema evolution without table rewrites, and time travel on data in S3. Which solution meets ALL requirements?
A. Redshift Spectrum with Parquet files B. **Amazon S3 with Apache Iceberg table format** C. Athena with standard Hive tables D. Lake Formation with standard S3 prefixes
> ✅ **B** — Apache Iceberg (v1.1) provides ACID transactions, schema/partition evolution, and time travel natively on S3. Hive tables lack row-level updates and time travel.

**Q10.** A data lake has 5 years of logs; 90+ days rarely accessed, 1+ year almost never accessed. Lifecycle config that minimises cost?
A. Move all to Glacier Deep Archive immediately B. Keep everything in S3 Standard C. **Transition to Standard-IA after 90 days, Glacier Flexible after 365 days** D. Intelligent-Tiering after 30 days for all files
> ✅ **C** — Standard-IA for 90+ day access; Glacier Flexible after a year of near-zero access. Deep Archive immediately adds 12h latency for the first 90 days; Standard is most expensive; Intelligent-Tiering suits unpredictable patterns, not this predictable aging.

**Q13.** A Glue Crawler discovered new S3 partitions, but they're not visible in Athena. Most likely cause?
A. **The Glue Data Catalog was not updated after the crawler ran** B. Athena doesn't support partitioned tables C. The S3 bucket is in a different region D. Parquet requires a schema registry
> ✅ **A** — Athena reads Catalog metadata; if partition metadata wasn't refreshed (e.g. MSCK REPAIR TABLE, re-running the crawler), new partitions won't appear. B, C, D are all false statements.

**Q16.** A DynamoDB hot partition receives 80% of writes, causing throttling. Best mitigation?
A. Enable DAX B. Switch to provisioned capacity with auto-scaling C. Create a GSI on the hot key D. **Use write sharding — append a random suffix to the partition key**
> ✅ **D** — Write sharding distributes writes across multiple physical partitions. DAX is a read cache (doesn't help writes); auto-scaling reacts after throttling; GSI has the same hotness problem.

### Part 3 questions

**Q5.** A startup runs ad-hoc SQL on 500GB of Parquet in S3, unpredictable query frequency. Most cost-effective solution?
A. **Amazon Athena with partitioned Parquet tables** B. Redshift provisioned cluster C. EMR cluster running continuously D. RDS PostgreSQL with S3 import
> ✅ **A** — Athena is pay-per-query-scanned ($5/TB). Redshift/EMR charge continuously regardless of use; RDS is for OLTP, not ad-hoc S3 analytics.

**Q8.** A Glue ETL job fails intermittently with "out of memory" on large partitions. Best fix?
A. Increase job timeout B. **Enable job bookmarks and increase DPUs (Data Processing Units)** C. Switch PySpark to Python shell D. Convert source to CSV
> ✅ **B** — More DPUs = more memory/executors for the Spark job. Timeout addresses time limits not memory; Python shell is single-node (worse); CSV doesn't reduce memory use.

**Q19.** A DataBrew data quality job finds 15% nulls in "customer_email." Need automatic alerts if the rate exceeds 10% in future runs. Best approach?
A. CloudWatch alarm on job duration B. **DataBrew data quality rule with threshold, connected to SNS on failure** C. Lambda function counting nulls after each job D. Enable CloudTrail on the DataBrew job
> ✅ **B** — DataBrew supports data quality rules with configurable thresholds; rule failure can trigger SNS via EventBridge — a declarative, code-free quality gate. Job duration measures performance not quality; custom Lambda is unnecessary; CloudTrail logs API calls not data stats.

### Part 4 questions

**Q6.** A data team needs column-level access — analysts see masked PII, data scientists see raw values. Which service provides this natively?
A. S3 bucket policies with condition keys B. IAM inline policies with resource-level permissions C. **AWS Lake Formation with column-level security and data filters** D. Amazon Macie with automatic remediation
> ✅ **C** — Lake Formation supports column-level security and data filters across Athena, Redshift Spectrum, EMR. S3 policies are object-level; IAM has no column awareness; Macie discovers but doesn't restrict.

**Q9.** A company needs S3 encryption with fully self-controlled keys, custom rotation, and cross-account access. Which option?
A. **SSE-KMS with a Customer Managed Key (CMK)** B. SSE-S3 with AWS-managed keys C. SSE-C with client-provided keys D. Client-side encryption before upload
> ✅ **A** — SSE-KMS + CMK gives custom rotation, IAM/key policy control, cross-account sharing, CloudTrail audit. SSE-S3 has no customer control; SSE-C requires providing keys on every request.

**Q11.** Which service auto-discovers and classifies sensitive PII in S3 buckets across an account?
A. AWS Config B. AWS CloudTrail C. Amazon Inspector D. **Amazon Macie**
> ✅ **D** — Macie uses ML to discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in S3. Config tracks configuration changes; CloudTrail logs API calls; Inspector scans EC2/Lambda for vulnerabilities.

**Q14.** Security team needs a complete, SQL-queryable audit trail of API calls for the last 90 days. Best solution?
A. CloudWatch Logs + Logs Insights B. Export CloudTrail to S3, query with Athena C. **Enable CloudTrail Lake, run SQL directly in console** D. AWS Config rules to query API history
> ✅ **C** — CloudTrail Lake is a managed event data store, auto-ingests CloudTrail events, SQL-queryable in-console, retains up to 7 years. B works but needs more setup; CloudWatch is app logs; Config tracks resource config, not API audit.

**Q18.** A team needs to share a Redshift warehouse with a partner in a different account — specific tables only, no copying to their S3. Which feature?
A. Export tables to S3, cross-account bucket sharing B. Create an assumable IAM role C. **Redshift Data Sharing with cross-account access and restricted consumer IAM** D. AWS DMS replicating specified tables
> ✅ **C** — Redshift Data Sharing gives live, read-only, no-copy access across accounts, restrictable to table/view level. S3 export copies data; IAM role gives full cluster access; DMS copies data — violates the no-copy requirement.

**Q20.** A company needs Lambda-to-RDS credentials with automatic 30-day rotation and auditable access logs. Best solution?
A. Lambda environment variables encrypted with KMS B. SSM Parameter Store (Standard) C. Hard-code credentials in the deployment package D. **AWS Secrets Manager with automatic rotation and CloudTrail logging**
> ✅ **D** — Secrets Manager is purpose-built for credentials: automatic rotation (Lambda rotator), versioning, CloudTrail logging of every access. Env vars have no auto-rotation; SSM auto-rotation requires custom setup; hard-coding is never acceptable.
